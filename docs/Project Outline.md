# Project Outline

## What is Gnoem?
Gnoem is an experimental simulation designed for research and learning purposes. It aims to create a progressively complex environment by simulating Gnoems—tiny beings influenced by natural selection, procedural generation, GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning), and Neural Networks. As an observer, you will witness the evolution of the Gnoem world, providing insights into the intersection of technology and the natural world.

## What is the goal for Gnoem?
The primary aim of Gnoem is to venture into unexplored territories of technologies and algorithms. As an experimental project, it anticipates encountering challenges like hiccups, performance bottlenecks, and necessary refactors. However, the overarching purpose remains rooted in enjoying the creative process and the learning journey. The delight comes not only from overcoming obstacles but also from the joy of witnessing little Gnoems meandering across the screen, bringing the simulation to life.

## Motivation for developing Gnoem
I'm driven by the desire to create a go-to project for experimentation—a canvas where I can delve into various ideas at my own pace. This project holds a special place as a playground for exploring my interest in graphics and procedural generation. The goal is to have a dedicated space for continuous experimentation and discovery within these domains.

## Project Scope
It is up to my and maybe others their imagination what the scope of this project will become. As of this writing, the project scope will be small and be split in multiple small milestones to get started. When there is a product that can actually be run, this section will probably be rewritten.
