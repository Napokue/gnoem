# Project Outline

## What is Gnoem?
Gnoem is an experimental simulation designed for research and learning purposes. It aims to create a progressively complex environment by simulating Gnoemsâ€”tiny beings influenced by natural selection, procedural generation, GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning), and Neural Networks. As an observer, you will witness the evolution of the Gnoem world, providing insights into the intersection of technology and the natural world.

## What is the goal for Gnoem?
The goal of Gnoem is to explore the possibilities of technologies and algorithm I haven't explored yet. This is an experimental project that will have its hiccups, performance bottle necks, refactors, and whatnot. Nevertheless, the purpose is to enjoy the creativity and le
