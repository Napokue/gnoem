# Project Outline

## What is Gnoem?
Gnoem is an experimental simulation designed for research and learning purposes. It aims to create a progressively complex environment by simulating Gnoemsâ€”tiny beings influenced by natural selection, procedural generation, GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning), and Neural Networks. As an observer, you will witness the evolution of the Gnoem world, providing insights into the intersection of technology and the natural world.
