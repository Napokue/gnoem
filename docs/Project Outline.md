# Project Outline

## What is Gnoem?
Gnoem is an experimental simulation designed for research and learning purposes. It aims to create a progressively complex environment by simulating Gnoemsâ€”tiny beings influenced by natural selection, procedural generation, GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning), and Neural Networks. As an observer, you will witness the evolution of the Gnoem world, providing insights into the intersection of technology and the natural world.

## What is the goal for Gnoem?
The primary aim of Gnoem is to venture into unexplored territories of technologies and algorithms. As an experimental project, it anticipates encountering challenges like hiccups, performance bottlenecks, and necessary refactors. However, the overarching purpose remains rooted in enjoying the creative process and the learning journey. The delight comes not only from overcoming obstacles but also from the joy of witnessing little Gnoems meandering across the screen, bringing the simulation to life.

## Motivation for writing Gnoem
My motivation is that I want to have one project I can return to when I want to experiment with things. I have a keen interest in Graphics
