# gnoem
Welcome to Gnoem, a captivating simulation that takes you into a little world inhabited by even littler beings. Inspired by a playful mispronunciation, Gnoem invites you to observe and delve into the intricacies of a tiny universe where the focus is on learning and discovery.

In Gnoem, you won't play a traditional game, but rather, you'll immerse yourself in a simulated environment. Your role is that of an observer, able to inspect and follow the daily lives of the gnomes as they navigate their miniature world. The catchphrase, "A little world, with little beings," perfectly encapsulates the essence of this project, emphasizing the minute details that make Gnoem unique.

Beyond the charming facade lies a deeper purpose. Gnoem is not just about whimsy; it's a platform for exploring concepts such as natural selection, procedural generation (both for the environment and the gnomes), and the implementation of a neural network. Watch as the gnomes adapt and learn from their mistakes through successive generations, providing a fascinating insight into the intersection of technology and the natural world.

Embark on this enlightening journey with Gnoem, where the simulation becomes a canvas for understanding, experimentation, and the extraordinary dance of life in a small, intricately crafted world.
